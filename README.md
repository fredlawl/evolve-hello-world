I wanted to learn more about evolutionary algorithms and to practice C
 programming. Therefore, I followed [this tutorial](https://www.electricmonk.nl/log/2011/09/28/evolutionary-algorithm-evolving-hello-world/)
 and translated the code into C.
 
Compilation should be as trivial as running: 
1. `cmake CMakeLists.txt` 
1. `make`
